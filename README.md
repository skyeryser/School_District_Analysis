# School District Analysis
## Discoveries
1. The charter schools represented in the data have higher reading and math scores than public schools. 
2. The test score difference between public and charter schools is relatively small for reading scores, but the average charter school math score is four points above that of public schools.
3. On average, all the charter schools in the data stayed below the mean budget of $898,693 for grades 
nine through twelve.
4. On average, the public schools in the data spent more than the mean budget of $898,693 for grades nine through eleven. 

## Additional Analysis
1. It would be helpful to cuantify the relationship between school budget and the number of students to see if dollars are being allocated based on the size of the student body.
2. If the average number of students for public schools is higher than charter schools, it might explain why public schools have higher budgets.
3. Furthermore, if the average number of students for public schools is higher than charter schools, it might explain why reading and math scores for public schools tend to be lower. 
4. Seeing the impact of the school budget on reading and math scores would clarify how money influences education.
5. One data point that might augment this project would be the total number of teachers. This information would help add detail to the school budget spend as well as student test scores.
